The Service Locator base class anti-pattern
===========================================

I wrote a blog post describing some techniques to move away from base class service location.

http://blog.csmac.nz/the-service-locator-base-class-antipattern/

This is a solution containing some MVC applications which contain the origional problem along
with solution attempts as well as what I would consider the 'right way'

Take these, and try writing tests against the controllers, or extending the functionality with
new controllers or actions to see why I believe the proposed solution would work the best in
most cases.
